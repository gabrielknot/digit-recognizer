# Digit Recognizer

A digit recognizer neural network from scratch.

I'm trying to do this in Rust, which is a new lenguage for me. At the begining this project will bea simpler learning path of lenguage, but in the future and as I hope, I pretend to implement this digit recognizer thing. But I just start this, because I see an asian on YouTube implementing this in python in 30 minutes, and that made me a litte dump.
